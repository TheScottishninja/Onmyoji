Onmyoji Version 0.3

Initiative System
	- The full initiative system is ready for testing! There is now a new process for adding tokens to initiative and advancing the turn.
	- Advance-Turn button for tokens has been removed.
	Start Combat:
		- To start combat, select all tokens that will be on the initiative table. 
		- In the button left, click "Dummy: CombatStart". This will add the tokens to the initiative list and prompt for initiative actions. Note: The button says Dummy beacause the macro is added to the Dummy token that every can control. Alternatively, typing !CombatStart in the chat window will also start the initiative.
		- In the chat, two buttons will appear: Roll and React. The Roll button will roll initiative normally for all currently selected tokens. The React button will prompt for a reaction target for the single selected token. That token's turn will come directly after the target.
		- Only one token can be selected when choosing the React option. You can react to allies and foes
		- After all tokens on the initiative list have selected either Roll or React, the initiative table will sort and display (not sure if it displays for players)
		- The first turn is started by pressing "Dummy: AdvanceTurn"

	**Advancing Turns:**
        - The AdvanceTurn button will move the initiative to the next player on the table. Like the previous button, all start of turn events will turn automatically (such as Living spell damage and continued casting).
        - If the token that receives initiative is being reacted to, the reacting tokens will be prompted to select their Reaction. This must be done before the token takes their turn actions. Reactions covered in detail later.
        - If the token that receives initiative reacted to a target, the chat will notify. This means that the token should have already taken its turn.
        - After all tokens have had their turn, the initiative table clears and initiative actions are selected again. The choice to roll initiative or react is available every turn and the turn order is adjusted accordingly each time.
    **End Combat:**
        - To clear the initiative and end combat, press "Dummy: CombatEnds" or "!CombatEnds" in the chat

**Reactions**
    - When reacting to a target, there are four reaction specific actions that can be taken: Counter, Full Defense, Bolster, and Follow-up. Counter and full defense are available if the target is a foe, Bolster and Follow-up if target is an ally. 
    - If the reaction selected does not resolve because the target did not perform the reactable action, then the character may take their turn normally. 

    **Counter:**
        - If the Counter reaction is taken, the character can attempt to cancel or weaken a spell as it is being cast. To do so, they must succeed at casting a spell of the opposing damage type.
        - On the target's turn, if they attempt to cast a spell, the casting will be paused before they select the target for the their spell.
        - Each character that is countering will be prompted to cast a counter spell. The damage type of the enemy spell is given and the player is responsible for select the opposing type.
        - Each successful counter-spell reduces the magnitude of the enemy spell by the magnitude of the counter. For example, if a Fire spell is cast with magnitude 5 and countered by a Water spell of magnitude 3, then the magnitude of the spell after countering is 2. 
        - If the sum of magnitudes from the counter-spells is greater than the original spell, then the spell is full countered and does not go off. The magnitude of the spell is not known until after the counter resolves.

    **Full Defense:**
        - If the Full Defense reaction is taken, the character is focused on avoiding attacks from the reaction target
        - If the target attacks the character specifically, the character gets a +5 on their dodge roll against the attack

    **Bolster:**
        - If the Bolster reaction is taken, the character aids the target ally in casting their next spell.
        - Aiding the casting is different for Talisman and Hand Seal spells.
        - For Talisman spells, the casting DC is reduced by 1 magnitude (currently equivalent to -4 DC). Also, if the ally fails the spell check, the Bolstering character may also attempt the spell check. If either succeeds, then the spell is cast.
        - For Hand Seal spells, there is no change to the DC for completing hand seals. However, if the ally fails a seal or completes all their hand seals per turn without completing the spell, then the Bolstering character may continue to complete the remaining hand seals. If all seals are completed between the target and Bolstering allies, then the spell is cast. 

    **Follow-Up:**
        - If the Follow-Up reaction is taken, the character coordinates their attack with the target ally.
        - If the target ally succeeds in attacking a foe (succeeds as in casting, they don't have to hit), then the character following up may attack that same foe and the foe will not be able to dodge the attack.

**New Spell: Exorcism**
    - Exorcism spells are AoE spells that are cast using Hand Seals
    - Unlike Area spells, Exorcism spells cannot be moved after their initial cast.
    - The damage from an exorcism spell does not apply when it's cast. Instead, any token that is within the area of the spell at the end of their turn takes damage.
    - Exorcism spells deal very high flat damage
    - Exorcism damage has a new type: "Drain" When Drain damage is dealt, it ignores spirit armor and has no resistance stat. As a result, the Drain damage is always directly taken by the target's Spirit. 
    - Drain damage does not deal damage to physical health.

Onmyoji Version 0.2

Auto Damage
	- All spells now automatically deal damage to the target(s). The true damage taken will be displayed in the chat feed
	- For players, damage taken will also be reflect in the spirit and health bars on the character sheet
	- For piercing damage, spirit creates (such as the dummies) will take piercing damage to their main health bar. Players will take the piercing damage to the health of the target body part.

Suicide (Defense Actions)
	- You can target yourself with spells to feel just how powerful you are!!
	- When a spell is targetted at you, buttons will appear in chat for the defensive actions you can take: Dodge, Ward, and Take Hit
	- Dodge will make an agility roll against a set DC. Succeeding the roll will avoid the attack for projectile and living spells, and take half damage for area spells. You only have one Dodge available per turn, so a second attack will not have a prompt to dodge.
	- Ward is the default defensive action. You protect yourself from the spell by forming a ward with your spirit energy. The ward takes the damage so your body doesn't have to. The damage is deducted from your spirit pool. As long as you have spirit remaining, you can ward an attack. However, running out of spirit will cancel any ongoing spells and prevent you from casting new ones.
	- Take the hit will forgo warding the attack and directly take health damage. The target body part will take all of the spell damage. In the future, taking damage to a body part has potential to cause and injury or permanent affliction.

New Spell: Basic Bind
	- A new hand seal spell is available that deals Bind damage
	- Bind Damage is applied to a separate health bar (the yellow second one). As the Bind health bar fills, the target's movement speed will be reduced proportionally (open the Combat section of the character sheet to see this). 
	- When the Bind bar is full, the target's speed goes to 0 and they are immobilized
	- The max value of the Bind bar is equivalent to the current spirit value. So binding becomes easier the more spirit damage taken. If spirit is 0, any binding damage will immobilize.
	- Binding damage is not permanent. The Basic Bind spell is a channel spell that only applies the damage while being channeled. If the channel fails or is cancelled, the binding damage is removed. 

Balance Changes
	- Lowered the DC for hand seals from 8 to 5. In the future, hand seal DC may be based on a function rather than a constant.
	- Character Levels have been changed from 5 to 1 so that spell checks are more varied. Increasing spell level on the character sheet will lower the cast/channel DC for spells.

Onmyoji Version 0.1

WIP Character Sheet
	- Core attributes and spirit pool are displayed on all pages of the character sheet
	- Current attribute check buttons are placeholder and may not function
	- Spells page contains the castable spells for each category. The spell button will display the spell description in chat and the button to initiate casting
	- Loadout page shows the current and total talismans for casting. Can currently edit both values and recieve an error message if max total exceeds the allows value
	- All other pages on the sheet are leftovers from the original sheet and are not functional

Core Spellcasting:
	Hand Seal Spells 
	- Form multiple consecutive hand seals to complete the casting of the spell.
	- Cast up to 4 hand seals in a turn. Can be split across multiple spells
	- Forming seals can continue on the following turn if the spell is not complete
	- Critical seals will either reduce the number of seals to cast by 1 or cast the spell as a critical

	Talisman Spells
	- Consume elemental talismans to cast spells with varied power.
	- Can choose to consume additional talismans to increase spell power, but also increase the casting DC
	- Talismans are still consumed on a failed cast
	- Talismans are automatically tracked on the loadout page of the character sheet 

Basic Spell Types:
	Projectile
	- Single target spells that allow for specific targeting of a body part when attacking
	- On a warded attacked, the spell partially pierces to deal damage to the target body part. Note that auto-damage does not apply from projectiles yet.
	- On a critical, the spell will have +50% magnitude and all damage will pierce
	Living
	- Single target spells that attach an elemental summon to the target. At the start of the target's turn, the summon will attach and deal damage. 
	- Living spells have flat damage that scales with magnitude the duration of the spell is rolled without scaling
	- Multiple instances of the same living spell can be stacked on a single target
	- Temporary auto damage is working for living spells. Advancing the targets turn will apply the damage
	- On a critical, the spell will cast twice on the target
	Area
	- AoE spells that deal damage to all targets with in the target area and can persist on following turns
	- Casting the spell creates a targeting token that the player can move. All tokens that are highlighted in yellow will be hit by the area spell
	- On the following turn after casting an area spell, the player can either channel or cancel the spell. Both options will roll a concentration check against the original spell DC. 
	- Channeling the spell will allows the player to move the area spell and deal damage again
	- Canceling the spell will remove the effect so a new spell can be cast
	- Failing on a check for channeling or canceling will result in loosing control of the spell. In the turn, this will have some random negative effect. 
	- Area spell damage scales with magnitude
	- On a critical, the spell get +50% magnitude and the area radius is increased by 10ft. If the spell is channeled, the spell magnitude returns to normal, but the area of the spell remains

Testing Features:
	Advance Turn
	- Any selected token will have a macro button in the top left called "Advance-Turn". Clicking this is equivalent to recieving initiative. This function allows for testing turn-based functions without using the initiative table.
	- On advancing turns, the following currently occurs:
		- Living spells apply damage and tick down in duration
		- Prompt to continue casting hand seal spell from previous turn
		- Prompt to channel or cancel area spell from previous turn
		- Reset dodges available 
		- Reset hand seals available
