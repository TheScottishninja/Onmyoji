WIP Character Sheet
	- Core attributes and spirit pool are displayed on all pages of the character sheet
	- Current attribute check buttons are placeholder and may not function
	- Spells page contains the castable spells for each category. The spell button will display the spell description in chat and the button to initiate casting
	- Loadout page shows the current and total talismans for casting. Can currently edit both values and recieve an error message if max total exceeds the allows value
	- All other pages on the sheet are leftovers from the original sheet and are not functional

Core Spellcasting:
	Hand Seal Spells 
	- Form multiple consecutive hand seals to complete the casting of the spell.
	- Cast up to 4 hand seals in a turn. Can be split across multiple spells
	- Forming seals can continue on the following turn if the spell is not complete
	- Critical seals will either reduce the number of seals to cast by 1 or cast the spell as a critical

	Talisman Spells
	- Consume elemental talismans to cast spells with varied power.
	- Can choose to consume additional talismans to increase spell power, but also increase the casting DC
	- Talismans are still consumed on a failed cast
	- Talismans are automatically tracked on the loadout page of the character sheet 

Basic Spell Types:
	Projectile
	- Single target spells that allow for specific targeting of a body part when attacking
	- On a warded attacked, the spell partially pierces to deal damage to the target body part. Note that auto-damage does not apply from projectiles yet.
	- On a critical, the spell will have +50% magnitude and all damage will pierce
	Living
	- Single target spells that attach an elemental summon to the target. At the start of the target's turn, the summon will attach and deal damage. 
	- Living spells have flat damage that scales with magnitude the duration of the spell is rolled without scaling
	- Multiple instances of the same living spell can be stacked on a single target
	- Temporary auto damage is working for living spells. Advancing the targets turn will apply the damage
	- On a critical, the spell will cast twice on the target
	Area
	- AoE spells that deal damage to all targets with in the target area and can persist on following turns
	- Casting the spell creates a targeting token that the player can move. All tokens that are highlighted in yellow will be hit by the area spell
	- On the following turn after casting an area spell, the player can either channel or cancel the spell. Both options will roll a concentration check against the original spell DC. 
	- Channeling the spell will allows the player to move the area spell and deal damage again
	- Canceling the spell will remove the effect so a new spell can be cast
	- Failing on a check for channeling or canceling will result in loosing control of the spell. In the turn, this will have some random negative effect. 
	- Area spell damage scales with magnitude
	- On a critical, the spell get +50% magnitude and the area radius is increased by 10ft. If the spell is channeled, the spell magnitude returns to normal, but the area of the spell remains

Testing Features:
	Advance Turn
	- Any selected token will have a macro button in the top left called "Advance-Turn". Clicking this is equivalent to recieving initiative. This function allows for testing turn-based functions without using the initiative table.
	- On advancing turns, the following currently occurs:
		- Living spells apply damage and tick down in duration
		- Prompt to continue casting hand seal spell from previous turn
		- Prompt to channel or cancel area spell from previous turn
		- Reset dodges available 
		- Reset hand seals available
