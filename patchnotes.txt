Onmyoji Version 0.2

Auto Damage
	- All spells now automatically deal damage to the target(s). The true damage taken will be displayed in the chat feed
	- For players, damage taken will also be reflect in the spirit and health bars on the character sheet
	- For piercing damage, spirit creates (such as the dummies) will take piercing damage to their main health bar. Players will take the piercing damage to the health of the target body part.

Suicide (Defense Actions)
	- You can target yourself with spells to feel just how powerful you are!!
	- When a spell is targetted at you, buttons will appear in chat for the defensive actions you can take: Dodge, Ward, and Take Hit
	- Dodge will make an agility roll against a set DC. Succeeding the roll will avoid the attack for projectile and living spells, and take half damage for area spells. You only have one Dodge available per turn, so a second attack will not have a prompt to dodge.
	- Ward is the default defensive action. You protect yourself from the spell by forming a ward with your spirit energy. The ward takes the damage so your body doesn't have to. The damage is deducted from your spirit pool. As long as you have spirit remaining, you can ward an attack. However, running out of spirit will cancel any ongoing spells and prevent you from casting new ones.
	- Take the hit will forgo warding the attack and directly take health damage. The target body part will take all of the spell damage. In the future, taking damage to a body part has potential to cause and injury or permanent affliction.

New Spell: Basic Bind
	- A new hand seal spell is available that deals Bind damage
	- Bind Damage is applied to a separate health bar (the yellow second one). As the Bind health bar fills, the target's movement speed will be reduced proportionally (open the Combat section of the character sheet to see this). 
	- When the Bind bar is full, the target's speed goes to 0 and they are immobilized
	- The max value of the Bind bar is equivalent to the current spirit value. So binding becomes easier the more spirit damage taken. If spirit is 0, any binding damage will immobilize.
	- Binding damage is not permanent. The Basic Bind spell is a channel spell that only applies the damage while being channeled. If the channel fails or is cancelled, the binding damage is removed. 

Balance Changes
	- Lowered the DC for hand seals from 8 to 5. In the future, hand seal DC may be based on a function rather than a constant.
	- Character Levels have been changed from 5 to 1 so that spell checks are more varied. Increasing spell level on the character sheet will lower the cast/channel DC for spells.

WIP Character Sheet
	- Core attributes and spirit pool are displayed on all pages of the character sheet
	- Current attribute check buttons are placeholder and may not function
	- Spells page contains the castable spells for each category. The spell button will display the spell description in chat and the button to initiate casting
	- Loadout page shows the current and total talismans for casting. Can currently edit both values and recieve an error message if max total exceeds the allows value
	- All other pages on the sheet are leftovers from the original sheet and are not functional

Core Spellcasting:
	Hand Seal Spells 
	- Form multiple consecutive hand seals to complete the casting of the spell.
	- Cast up to 4 hand seals in a turn. Can be split across multiple spells
	- Forming seals can continue on the following turn if the spell is not complete
	- Critical seals will either reduce the number of seals to cast by 1 or cast the spell as a critical

	Talisman Spells
	- Consume elemental talismans to cast spells with varied power.
	- Can choose to consume additional talismans to increase spell power, but also increase the casting DC
	- Talismans are still consumed on a failed cast
	- Talismans are automatically tracked on the loadout page of the character sheet 

Basic Spell Types:
	Projectile
	- Single target spells that allow for specific targeting of a body part when attacking
	- On a warded attacked, the spell partially pierces to deal damage to the target body part. Note that auto-damage does not apply from projectiles yet.
	- On a critical, the spell will have +50% magnitude and all damage will pierce
	Living
	- Single target spells that attach an elemental summon to the target. At the start of the target's turn, the summon will attach and deal damage. 
	- Living spells have flat damage that scales with magnitude the duration of the spell is rolled without scaling
	- Multiple instances of the same living spell can be stacked on a single target
	- Temporary auto damage is working for living spells. Advancing the targets turn will apply the damage
	- On a critical, the spell will cast twice on the target
	Area
	- AoE spells that deal damage to all targets with in the target area and can persist on following turns
	- Casting the spell creates a targeting token that the player can move. All tokens that are highlighted in yellow will be hit by the area spell
	- On the following turn after casting an area spell, the player can either channel or cancel the spell. Both options will roll a concentration check against the original spell DC. 
	- Channeling the spell will allows the player to move the area spell and deal damage again
	- Canceling the spell will remove the effect so a new spell can be cast
	- Failing on a check for channeling or canceling will result in loosing control of the spell. In the turn, this will have some random negative effect. 
	- Area spell damage scales with magnitude
	- On a critical, the spell get +50% magnitude and the area radius is increased by 10ft. If the spell is channeled, the spell magnitude returns to normal, but the area of the spell remains

Testing Features:
	Advance Turn
	- Any selected token will have a macro button in the top left called "Advance-Turn". Clicking this is equivalent to recieving initiative. This function allows for testing turn-based functions without using the initiative table.
	- On advancing turns, the following currently occurs:
		- Living spells apply damage and tick down in duration
		- Prompt to continue casting hand seal spell from previous turn
		- Prompt to channel or cancel area spell from previous turn
		- Reset dodges available 
		- Reset hand seals available
